            <p>
                Hey, my name is Alexis. I'm currently in my third year here at UNC Charlotte majoring in Computer Science with a focus in Cybersecurity 
                and a minor in Bioinformatics and Mathematics. Love thrifting and hanging with family and friends, also love gaming–into Marvel Rivals at the moment.
