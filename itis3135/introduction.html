            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>
                Hey, my name is Alexis. I'm currently in my third year here at UNC Charlotte majoring in Computer Science with a focus in Cybersecurity 
                and a minor in Bioinformatics and Mathematics. Love thrifting and hanging with family and friends, also love gaming–into Marvel Rivals at the moment.

            <h3>About Me</h3>
                <ul class="facts">
                    <li>
                        <b>Personal Background: </b>I was born and raised here in Charlotte, North Carolina. As a first-gen student, I’m really determined with my studies 
                        and do enjoy learning new things. I speak English, Spanish and a little bit of French.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Professional Background: </b> Worked as a Senior Operations Director at Chick-fil-a for 3 years, now work as an associate at the Home Depot.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Academic Background: </b> Third Year Junior–Computer Science, Cybersecurity–Bioinformatics & Mathematics Minors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Current Courses: </b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>BINF 1101 Intro. Bioinformatics and Genomics</li>
                            <li>ITIS 3135 Front End Web App Development</li>
                            <li>ITIS 3200 Intro. Info Security and Privacy</li>
                            <li>ITSC 3146 Intro. Oper Syst & Networking</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Background in this Course: </b>I used to hate coding back in high school, but after sticking with it I’ve grown into a love/hate relationship where the challenge is half the fun—ITIS 3135 is part of that journey to sharpen my front-end skills.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Primary Computer Platform: </b>Apple MacBook Air running macOS, which doubles as my go-to machine for class, development, and personal projects.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Funny/Interesting Story: </b>I’m double-jointed in both my shoulders and my thumbs—apparently useful when you’re reaching behind racks at thrift stores.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Something Else to Share: </b>Coding and I have an odd relationship; when a bug appears I swear it off, and as soon as it’s solved I can’t wait to dive back in for more.
                    </li>
