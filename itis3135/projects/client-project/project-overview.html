    <!-- PROJECT OVERVIEW -->
    <section>
      <h3>Project Overview</h3>

      <h4>Client and Project Category</h4>
      <p>
        For this project, I selected <strong>Category 02 – client outside of the class</strong>.
        My client is an individual, <strong>Rutilo De La Luz</strong>, who owns a small construction
        business named <strong>T&amp;O</strong> in the Charlotte, NC area. This project falls under the
        category of <strong>“an individual that you know to promote their professional projects.”</strong>
        The goal of the website is to increase the visibility of T&amp;O, improve communication with
        potential customers, and provide an easy way for visitors to request construction services.
      </p>

      <h4>Application Description and Purpose</h4>
      <p>
        The “T&amp;O” web application is a multi-page promotional website for a Charlotte-based
        construction business owned by Rutilo De la Luz. Its purpose is to showcase completed
        roofing, siding, exterior remodeling, and interior remodeling projects, clearly communicate the
        range of services offered, and make it easy for potential clients to request quotes or
        consultations online. The site will highlight real project photos, describe the company’s
        capabilities, and provide simple, user-friendly forms to initiate contact and service
        requests.

        The default page layout wireframe and the sitemap for the T&amp;O construction website
        were created using draw.io and saved to my UNCC Google Drive. They illustrate the
        overall structure of the home page and how visitors navigate between the main pages.

    <!-- DYNAMIC FUNCTIONALITY -->
    <section>
      <h3>Dynamic Functionality</h3>
      <p>
        The T&amp;O website will include several pieces of dynamic functionality implemented
        with JavaScript, jQuery, and jQuery UI. These features are designed to improve
        usability and demonstrate interactive web design techniques that do not require
        server-side data storage.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Interactive Project Gallery (projects.html):</strong>
          A grid of project thumbnails can be filtered by service type, and each thumbnail
          opens a larger image and more details in a lightbox or modal overlay. Project data
          (title, service type, description, image path) will be stored in a static JSON file
          and loaded using AJAX.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Service Tabs or Accordion (services.html):</strong>
          jQuery UI tabs or an accordion will organize roofing, siding, exterior remodeling, and
          interior remodeling content. This allows visitors to switch between service categories
          without reloading the page.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>About Page Accordion (about.html):</strong>
          An optional accordion will present “Our Story,” “Our Work Philosophy,” and
          “Why Choose T&amp;O” as expandable sections, making it easier to scan and read.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Contact Form Validation (contact.html):</strong>
          JavaScript will validate required fields and email format before allowing the
          quote request form to be submitted. If the form is valid, a confirmation
          message and a summary of the user’s input will be displayed on the page.
        </li>
      </ul>
