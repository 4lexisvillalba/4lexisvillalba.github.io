                        T&amp;O Construction grew from Rutilo’s drive to combine precise craftsmanship with care for his
                        community. What started as small repairs for friends has expanded into full exterior and interior
                        renovation services trusted throughout the Queen City.

                <p>
                    After apprenticing under seasoned roofers and remodelers, Rutilo founded T&amp;O to provide a dependable
                    option for homeowners in Charlotte’s diverse neighborhoods. His goal was simple: show up prepared,
                    communicate clearly, and leave every property better than it was found. That promise still guides the
                    company today, whether we are repairing a roofline after summer storms or planning a full exterior redesign.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The “T&amp;O” name is a tribute to his family, reminding the crew that every project protects a real
                    household. Each estimate, material selection, and clean-up checklist reflects that responsibility.
