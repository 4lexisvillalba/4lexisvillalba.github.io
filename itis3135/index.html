            <h2>ITIS 3135 Course Home</h2>

            <p>
                Welcome to the home page for ITIS 3135 Front End Web App Development. This site serves as the central hub 
                for my work in the course, including assignments, labs, and other related materials.
            </p>

            <p>
                Throughout this course, I will be learning and applying core front-end concepts such as semantic HTML, 
                CSS for layout and styling, responsive design, accessibility best practices, and client-side interaction. 
                The goal is to develop clean, standards-compliant web pages that are both functional and user-friendly.
            </p>
